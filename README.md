Objective is to simplify the procedure of aligning educational content with specific subjects in a curriculum. To achieve this, we are creating a precise and effective model that is trained on a vast collection of K-12 educational materials, systematically arranged into various topic taxonomies. The materials in this collection are in multiple languages and encompass a broad spectrum of subjects, with a particular emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) topics.
